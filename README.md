# Day 4-5: Learning HTML - Lists, Tables & Forms

This repository contains my practice work from Day 4 and Day 5 of learning HTML.
I followed the **Apna College HTML Tutorial Series** to understand how to structure web pages using lists, tables, and basic form elements.

## ✅ Topics Learned

### 1. Lists

* **Ordered List** (`<ol>`)
* **Unordered List** (`<ul>`)
* **List Items** (`<li>`)

### 2. Tables

* `<table>` - Table container
* `<tr>` - Table row
* `<th>` - Table header cells
* `<td>` - Table data cells

### 3. Forms

* `<form>` - Used to collect user input
* `<label>` - Label for input field
* `<input>` - Text / Email / Password fields
* `<textarea>` - Multi-line input box
* `<button>` - Submit button

### 4. Difference Between `<div>` and `<span>`

| Tag      | Element Type | Behavior                                             |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<div>`  | Block-Level  | Takes full width and starts on a new line            |
| `<span>` | Inline       | Takes only required width and stays in the same line |
