# Day-4-5-HTML-Practice-Lists-Tables-Forms
Practice work from Day 4-5 of learning HTML through the Apna College series. Learned how to create ordered and unordered lists, tables using tr/th/td, and basic forms with input fields. Also understood the difference between block-level &lt;div> and inline &lt;span>. For learning purposes only.
